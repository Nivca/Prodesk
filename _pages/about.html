                <h2>Our story</h2>
                <p>
                    I have been searching for a standing desk for more than 3 years, I couldn't find one which was affortable, I had to use 
                    unstable cardboard boxes. I was tired of searching, So I asked my friend to help me to build one and we did it! I started 
                    my new standing desk and I loved it. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    I figured more people will have faced the same problem as me so we started <strong>Prodesk life</strong> to help 
                    people.
