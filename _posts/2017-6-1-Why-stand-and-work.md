Too much of anything kills. The same is true of fried food, alcohol, and now – researchers have found out – ‘Sitting’. Sitting
too much can kill you. Sounds dramatic, but it’s true.

A study reveals that men who sit 6 hours or more a day have an overall death rate that’s 20% higher than men who sit for
3 hours or less. For women, it’s 40%. And consider this: nothing you do can cancel out the effects of sitting for
long hours in the office. Sitting harms you even if you benefit from a gym workout. Whenever possible, office workers
are advised to get up and take movement breaks throughout the day. It’s not always easy to just walk away from
the task at hand, though, so in some cases workers are combining the best of both worlds by installing Standing
Desks.
